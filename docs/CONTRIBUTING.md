# Welcome to Trevas docs contributing guide

## Getting started

### Install dependencies

Run `yarn`

### Start local server

By default, `yarn start` script will display English content (defined [here](docs/)).

The documentation is also currently available in Chinese (content defined [here](i18n/zh-CN/)), in French (content defined [here](i18n/fr/)) and Norwegian ((content defined [here](i18n/no/))).

Run `yarn start-zh-CN`, `yarn start-fr` or `yarn start-no` to run locally the documentation is these languages.

You can also run locally the multi language documentation thanks to `yarn build-serve` (caution, hot reloading will not be provided in this mode).
