## Documentation

The VTL documentation is available on the official [SDMX](https://sdmx.org/) web site:

- [User manual](https://sdmx.org/wp-content/uploads/VTL-2.0-User-Manual-20180416-final.pdf)
- [Reference manual](https://sdmx.org/wp-content/uploads/VTL-2.0-Reference-Manual-20180712-final.pdf)

## Datasets

VTL datasets must be described by metadata. The different columns have a `type` and a `role`.

By default, in Trevas, a column without type or role will be assigned a `string` `type` and a `measure` `role`.

The user will then be able to mutate these attributes in the script, in particular via the `calc` and `cast` operators.

## Simple example

Considering `ds_1` defined as follows:

|      | id_1       | id_2       | me_1    |
| ---- | ---------- | ---------- | ------- |
| type | string     | string     | string  |
| role | identifier | identifier | measure |

| id_1    | id_2 | me_1  |
| ------- | ---- | ----- |
| "75001" | "75" | "10"  |
| "75002" | "75" | "100" |
| "70001" | "70" | "5"   |
| "70002" | "70" | "70"  |

To obbtain the sum of `me_1` by `id_2`, only `id_2` has to have the `identifier` role and `me_1` has to have the `integer` type. The following scipt is thus applied:

```
ds_2 := ds_1[calc measure id_2 := id_2, me_1 := cast(me_1, integer)];
```

`ds_2` is then:

|      | id_1    | id_2       | me_1    |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ------- |
| type | string  | string     | integer |
| role | measure | identifier | measure |

| id_1    | id_2 | me_1 |
| ------- | ---- | ---- |
| "75001" | "75" | 10   |
| "75002" | "75" | 100  |
| "70001" | "70" | 5    |
| "70002" | "70" | 70   |

It is now possible to apply the `aggr` operator:

```
ds_3 := ds_2[aggr sum_me_1 := sum(me_1) group by id_2];
```

To obtain `ds_3`:

|      | id_2       | sum_me_1 |
| ---- | ---------- | -------- |
| type | string     | integer  |
| role | identifier | measure  |

| id_2 | me_1 |
| ---- | ---- |
| "75" | 110  |
| "70" | 75   |
