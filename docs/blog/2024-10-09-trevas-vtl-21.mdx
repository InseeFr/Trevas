Trevas 1.7.0 upgrade to version 2.1 of VTL.

This version introduces two new operators:

- `random`
- `case`

`random` produces a decimal number between 0 and 1.

`case` allows for clearer multi conditional branching, for example:

`ds2 := ds1[ calc c := case when r < 0.2 then "Low" when r > 0.8 then "High" else "Medium" ]`

Both operators are already available in Trevas!

The new grammar also provides time operators and includes corrections, without any breaking changes compared to the 2.0 version.

See the <Link label={"coverage"} href={useBaseUrl('/user-guide/coverage')} /> section for more details.
