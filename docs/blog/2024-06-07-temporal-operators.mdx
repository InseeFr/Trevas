### Temporal operators in Trevas

The version 1.4.0 of Trevas introduces preliminary support for date and time types
and operators.

The specification describes temporal types such as `date`, `time_period`, `time`, and `duration`. However, Trevas authors find
these descriptions unsatisfactory. This blog post outlines our implementation choices and how they differ from the spec.

In the specification, `time_period` (and the types `date`) is described as a compound type with a start and end (or a
start and a duration). This complicates the implementation and brings little value to the language as one can simply
operate on a combination of dates or date and duration directly. For this reason, we defined an algebra between the
temporal types and did not yet implement the `time_period`.

| result (operators) | date        | duration        | number        |
| ------------------ | ----------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| **date**           | n/a         | date (+, -)     | n/a           |
| **duration**       | date (+, -) | duration (+, -) | duration (\*) |
| **number**         | n/a         | duration (\*)   | n/a           |

The `period_indicator` function relies on period-awareness for types that are not defined enough at the moment to
be implemented.

#### Java mapping

The VTL type `date` is represented internally as the
types [`java.time.Instant`](https://docs.oracle.com/en%2Fjava%2Fjavase%2F11%2Fdocs%2Fapi%2F%2F/java.base/java/time/Instant.html),
[`java.time.ZonedDateTime`](https://docs.oracle.com/en%2Fjava%2Fjavase%2F11%2Fdocs%2Fapi%2F%2F/java.base/java/time/ZonedDateTime.html)
and [`java.time.OffsetDateTime`](https://docs.oracle.com/en%2Fjava%2Fjavase%2F11%2Fdocs%2Fapi%2F%2F/java.base/java/time/OffsetDateTime.html#:~:text=OffsetDateTime%20is%20an%20immutable%20representation,be%20stored%20in%20an%20OffsetDateTime%20.)

Instant represent a specific moment in time. Note that this type does not include timezone information and is therefore
not usable with all the operators. One can use the types `ZonedDateTime` and `OffsetDateTime` when timezone or time
saving is required.

The VTL type `duration` is represented internally as the
type [`org.threeten.extra.PeriodDuration`](https://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/apidocs/org.threeten.extra/org/threeten/extra/PeriodDuration.html)
from the [threeten extra](https://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/) package.
It represents a duration using both calendar units (years, months, days) and a temporal amount (hours, minutes, seconds
and nanoseconds).

#### Function `flow_to_stock`

The flow_to_stock function converts a data set with flow interpretation into a stock interpretation. This transformation
is useful when you want to aggregate flow data (e.g., sales or production rates) into cumulative stock data (e.g., total
inventory).

**Syntax:**

`result := flow_to_stock(op)`

**Parameters:**

- `op` - The input data set with flow interpretation. The data set must have an identifier of type `time`, additional
  identifiers, and at least one measure of type `number`.

**Result:**

The function returns a data set with the same structure as the input, but with the values converted to stock
interpretation.

#### Function `stock_to_flow`

The `stock_to_flow` function converts a data set with stock interpretation into a flow interpretation. This
transformation is useful when you want to derive flow data from cumulative stock data.

**Syntax:**

`result := stock_to_flow(op)`

**Parameters:**

- `op` - The input data set with stock interpretation. The data set must have an identifier of type `time`, additional
  identifiers, and at least one measure of type `number`.

**Result:**

The function returns a data set with the same structure as the input, but with the values converted to flow
interpretation.

#### Function `timeshift`

The `timeshift` function shifts the time component of a specified range of time in the data set. This is useful for
analyzing data at different time offsets, such as comparing current values to past values.

**Syntax:**

`result := timeshift(op, shiftNumber)`

**Parameters:**

- `op` - The operand data set containing time series.
- `shiftNumber` - An integer representing the number of periods to shift. Positive values shift forward in time, while
  negative values shift backward.

**Result:**

The function returns a data set with the time identifiers shifted by the specified number of periods.
