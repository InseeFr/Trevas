# 🚀 Contributing to Trevas

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Trevas! Your help is invaluable in improving this project. Here’s how you can get started.

## 🛠️ Contribution Guidelines

### 📌 Roles & Responsibilities

- **[Insee](https://www.insee.fr/en)** is responsible for the overall **project governance**. They guide the vision of the project, make final decisions, and ensure the project aligns with its long-term goals.
- **[Making Sense](https://making-sense.info/)** are responsible for reviewing **Pull Requests (PRs)**, merging them into the master branch, adjusting the **GitHub project board**, and tagging issues to ensure proper tracking. They ensure the code meets the project's standards before merging and help prioritize tasks.
- **Maintainers** (which can include anyone who is granted this role) help with day-to-day management of the project, such as reviewing code, merging PRs, and managing the project's direction. If you're interested in becoming a maintainer, please see the section below.

### 📌 Issues & Pull Requests

- Every **Pull Request (PR) must be linked to an existing issue**
- When creating a PR, use the following naming convention:
  - **`feat/your-feature-name`** for new features
  - **`fix/your-bug-fix`** for bug fixes
- Discuss your ideas in an issue before starting major work

### 👀 Four Eyes Principle & Code Review Practices

To ensure the quality, reliability, and security of Trevas, we follow the **Four Eyes Principle** for all code contributions.

#### 🔍 What is the Four Eyes Principle?

The **Four Eyes Principle** means that **at least two people must review and approve any important action** before it is finalized. In the context of Trevas, this applies specifically to:

- Pull Request (PR) reviews and approvals
- Merges into the `develop` or `master` branches
- Structural changes in architecture, testing strategy, or documentation

This principle helps:
- Catch potential bugs or security issues early
- Encourage collaborative development
- Share knowledge across the team
- Avoid single points of failure or bias in code review

#### ✅ Code Review Guidelines

All Pull Requests should:

- Be reviewed by **at least one other maintainer** who is **not the author**
- Receive **two approvals** if the PR is large, critical, or affects core logic
- Be **linked to an existing issue**
- Follow the **project’s formatting rules**
- Include relevant **unit or integration tests**
- Be tested locally (or via CI) to ensure nothing is broken

**Only after meeting these conditions can a PR be merged**.

Maintainers are expected to **uphold these principles** and ensure reviews are thoughtful, constructive, and inclusive.  
We believe that code review is not just a checkpoint, but a space to learn, improve, and grow as a team.

> 🤝 If you're contributing regularly and want to become a maintainer, don't hesitate to reach out to us at **contact@making-sense.info** — we’d love to welcome more eyes to the team!

### 🧪 Test-Driven Development (TDD)

We encourage a **test-driven approach** to ensure code reliability and maintainability:

1. **Write a failing test** for the feature or bug fix
2. **Implement the code** needed to pass the test
3. **Refactor** while ensuring all tests remain green

### 🎨 Code Formatting

To keep our codebase consistent, please follow these formatting guidelines:

- **Indentation**: Use tabs for indentation
- **Line Length**: Keep lines under 120 characters
- **Naming**: Use meaningful and descriptive English names for variables, functions, and classes

## 🔄 Creating a Pull Request

To contribute, follow these steps:

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a branch** from `develop` using the correct prefix (`feat/` or `fix/`). Example: `feat/authentication` or `fix/typo-readme`
3. **Commit** your changes with a clear and concise message
4. **Push** your branch to your fork
5. **Open a Pull Request** targeting the `develop` branch

Your PR should:

✅ Reference an [existing issue](https://github.com/InseeFr/Trevas/issues)  
✅ Include a clear description of the changes  
✅ Be tested and follow the formatting rules mentioned above
