## 🛠️ Contribution Guidelines

### 📌 Roles & Responsibilities

- **AAA** is responsible for the overall **project governance**. They guide the vision of the project, make final decisions, and ensure the project aligns with its long-term goals.
- **BBB and CCC** are responsible for reviewing **Pull Requests (PRs)**, merging them into the main branch, adjusting the **GitHub project board**, and tagging issues to ensure proper tracking. They ensure the code meets the project's standards before merging and help prioritize tasks.
- **Maintainers** (which can include anyone who is granted this role) help with day-to-day management of the project, such as reviewing code, merging PRs, and managing the project's direction. If you're interested in becoming a maintainer, please see the section below.

### 📌 Issues & Pull Requests

- Every **Pull Request (PR) must be linked to an existing issue**.
- When creating a PR, use the following naming convention:
    - **`Feat/your-feature-name`** for new features.
    - **`Fix/your-bug-fix`** for bug fixes.
- Discuss your ideas in an issue before starting major work.

### 🧪 Test-Driven Development (TDD)

We encourage a **test-driven approach** to ensure code reliability and maintainability:

1. **Write a failing test** for the feature or bug fix.
2. **Implement the code** needed to pass the test.
3. **Refactor** while ensuring all tests remain green.

### 🎨 Code Formatting

To keep our codebase consistent, please follow these formatting guidelines:

- **Indentation**: Use tabs for indentation.
- **Line Length**: Keep lines under 120 characters.
- **Naming**: Use meaningful and descriptive English names for variables, functions, and classes.

## 🔄 Creating a Pull Request

To contribute, follow these steps:

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Create a branch** from `develop` using the correct prefix (`Feat/` or `Fix/`). Example: `Feat/authentication` or `Fix/typo-readme`.
3. **Commit** your changes with a clear and concise message.
4. **Push** your branch to your fork.
5. **Open a Pull Request** targeting the `develop` branch.
