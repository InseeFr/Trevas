## Creating a pull request

Pull requests have to come from branch prefixed by `feature/` or `fix/`.

Ideally, pull requests contain a reference to a previously filled [Trevas issue](https://github.com/InseeFr/Trevas/issues).

Your submissions must be targeted at the `develop` branch of the [main Trevas repository](https://github.com/InseeFr/Trevas).
