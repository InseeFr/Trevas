## üìã Governance Overview

Trevas is hosted and governed by **[Insee](https://www.insee.fr/en)**, which ensures the long-term vision and sustainability of the project. However, **[Making Sense](https://making-sense.info/)**, as the main contributor, is entrusted with the **management of the project‚Äôs roadmap, issue prioritization, and day-to-day operational decisions**.

This model ensures a balance between institutional support and active community-led development.
